# Printing
When in python, to show output on the console you should include a print statement.
You can directly include what you want to print, as below:

```
print(5)
print("look guys! I'm coding!")
```

or you can use variable names to print the variables:

  ```
x = 26
print(x)
```

you can also print both at the same time

```
print(x, "cats")
```
